# 🏷️ Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overwiew

In this Data Science project, you will see how to build a Car Price Prediction from scratch using Machine Learning Techniques.

One of the main areas of research in machine learning is the prediction of the price of cars. It is based on finance and the marketing domain. 

## Project structure
The datasets used in this project is:
- `CarPrice.csv`

Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing and visualization:

- `learn.ipynb`

## Results

<!-- The system analyzes network security and classifies network attacks based on the exploring of inherent patterns in network traffic data. -->

## Steps

**1. Data Loading and Exploration:**
   - Load the datasets using pandas.
   - Display the first few rows to understand the structure of the dataset.
   - Check for missing values and data types.

**2. Visualization:**
   - Visualize the data on a 2D plot.

**3. Data Preprocessing:**
   - Extract relevant features.
   - Group by items and create a new column.

**4. k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**
   - Apply the kNN algorithm.
   - Convert our table to a 2D matrix, and fill the missing values with zeros.

## Results

The system analyzes a reader's preferences based on their reading history and suggests books that are most likely to interest the user.
