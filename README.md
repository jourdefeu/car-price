# üè∑Ô∏è Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overwiew

In this Data Science project, you will see how to build a Network Attack Classifier from scratch using Machine Learning Techniques.

Network Security is the general practice of protecting computer networks and devices accessible to the network against malicious intent, misuse and denial. 

## Project structure
The datasets used in this project are:
- `KDDTrain+.txt`
- `KDDTest+.txt`

Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing and visualization:

- `learn.ipynb`

## Results

The system analyzes network security and classifies network attacks based on the exploring of inherent patterns in network traffic data.
